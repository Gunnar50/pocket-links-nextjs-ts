# Conway's Game of Life React & TypeScript

## 🌐 Project

PocketLinks is a simple front-end web application designed to maintain a list of bookmarks
(links), allowing users to add, edit, and delete links. The app is built using only front-end
technologies (no backend database). The application relies on the use of redux and local
storage to persist the user data.
